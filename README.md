## Introduction

_TODO_

## Debugging

To debug the application locally outside of the integration tests, you will need
to [create a GitHub OAuth app] to obtain secrets for the `GitHub:ClientId` and
`GitHub:ClientSecret` options so that the [OAuth user authentication] works and
you can log into the Todo App UI.

> üí° When creating the GitHub OAuth app, use `https://localhost:5001/sign-in-github`
as the _Authorization callback URL_.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit GitHub OAuth secrets to source control. Configure them
with [User Secrets] instead.

## Building and Testing

Compiling the application yourself requires Git and the
[.NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core "Download the .NET SDK")
to be installed.

To build and test the application locally from a terminal/command-line, run the
following set of commands:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/martincostello/polly-rate-limiting.git
cd polly-rate-limiting
./build.ps1
```
